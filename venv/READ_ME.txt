The python file that needs to be ran is called Project2Part3.py. This file imports arff from spicy.io as well as scipy.spatial.distance. We did not need any extra files or downloads in order for our program to run. As you run the program, it will ask the user to enter the file name of your training file, followed by the file name of your testing file. Assuming the arff file names entered are correct, the program will run and will display the predicted class label for every test row using the four different distance measures. This is followed by the values in the confusion matrix and the precision, recall and F-1 measures of the four different distances for the first class label and the second class label separately. All of this is repeated for each of the 5 required k values.
